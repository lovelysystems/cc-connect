# Microsoft Teams

cc-connect connects to Microsoft Teams as a Bot Framework bot. Unlike the
outbound-connection platforms (Slack socket mode, Feishu websocket), Teams
delivers messages by **POSTing to a public HTTPS webhook**, so this platform
requires a publicly reachable URL.

## How it works

- Azure Bot Service relays Teams messages to the connector's webhook
  (`/api/messages` by default) as Bot Framework activities.
- The connector validates each request's JWT, then forwards the message to the
  cc-connect engine.
- Replies are sent back through the Bot Connector REST API and stream as an
  **Adaptive Card**: a "working" card is posted immediately, then edited in place
  as the answer grows. Every card — the working card included — carries the native
  "AI generated" label, so it is present from the first render. The card
  renders uniformly in channels, group chats, and 1:1 (unlike the native
  `streamType` protocol, which is one-on-one only).

Engagement model: in a **channel or group chat**, an **@mention** of the bot
engages that reply thread; subsequent messages **in that thread** are then
followed without re-mentioning. A message that @mentions other people but not the
bot is treated as human-to-human side chatter and ignored. Engagement is
persisted under the cc-connect data dir (`<data_dir>/teams/<project>-engaged.json`),
so it survives a restart. In a **1:1 (personal) chat** the bot responds to every
message — Teams does not allow @mentioning a bot there.

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure Bot resource** (Azure Portal → "Azure Bot"), created as a
  **single-tenant** app. Note its **Microsoft App ID**, its **tenant (directory)
  ID**, and create a **client secret**. (Multi-tenant bots are not supported —
  Azure deprecated their creation after 2025-07-31.)
- The bot's **Microsoft Teams** channel enabled.
- A public HTTPS endpoint that routes to the connector's webhook port.

## Setup

1. **Create the Azure Bot** (single-tenant) and record the App ID, tenant ID, and client secret.
2. **Set the messaging endpoint** (Azure Bot → Configuration →
   "Messaging endpoint") to:

   ```
   https://<your-host><webhook_path>
   ```

   where `<webhook_path>` matches your config (default `/api/messages`).
3. **Enable the Teams channel** (Azure Bot → Channels → Microsoft Teams).
4. **Configure cc-connect** — add a Teams platform to your project:

   ```toml
   [[projects.platforms]]
   type = "teams"

   [projects.platforms.options]
   app_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Azure Bot App (client) ID
   app_password = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"              # Azure Bot client secret
   tenant_id = "<your-tenant-id>"                   # required — AAD tenant that owns the bot (single-tenant)
   webhook_port = "3978"                            # local bind port
   webhook_path = "/api/messages"                   # must match the messaging endpoint path
   allow_from = "*"                                 # "*"/empty = all users in the tenant, or AAD object IDs
   session_scope = "thread"                         # "thread" (default) | "channel" | "user"
   card_update_interval_ms = 1500                   # streaming card edit throttle (ms)
   ```

   > **Access control:** the connector is **single-tenant** (`tenant_id` required), so only
   > users in that one organization can reach the bot. `allow_from = "*"` (the default) then
   > permits everyone in the tenant; set an AAD-object-ID allowlist to restrict to specific
   > people when you want a tighter boundary.

5. **Expose the webhook.** Put a reverse proxy / ingress with TLS in front of
   `webhook_port`, or use a tunnel (e.g. for local testing) so Azure Bot Service
   can reach `https://<your-host><webhook_path>`.
6. **Install the bot in Teams** (sideload an app manifest pointing at your bot,
   or add it from your org's catalog) and @mention it to start.

## Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `app_id` | yes | — | Azure Bot App (client) ID; the inbound JWT audience |
| `app_password` | yes | — | Azure Bot client secret (outbound token) |
| `tenant_id` | **yes** | — | AAD tenant that owns the bot. Single-tenant only — Azure deprecated multi-tenant bot creation after 2025-07-31 |
| `webhook_port` | no | `3978` | Local port the webhook binds to |
| `webhook_path` | no | `/api/messages` | Path of the messaging endpoint |
| `allow_from` | no | `""` | Comma-separated AAD object IDs allowed to use the bot; `*` or empty = all users in the tenant |
| `session_scope` | no | `thread` | `thread` (one session per reply thread), `channel` (one shared session across the channel), `user` (one session per user within a thread) |
| `card_update_interval_ms` | no | `1500` | Streaming-card edit throttle in ms; Teams rate-limits edits to ~1/s |
| `card_loading_text` | no | `""` | Label on the placeholder card shown while the agent works (e.g. `💭 Thinking…`); empty renders a label-less card |
| `service_url_allowlist` | no | `""` | Comma-separated hosts the bot may send replies to. Empty = any JWT-validated host (default). Set it to pin the bot to your cloud's Bot Connector host(s) as defense-in-depth. See "serviceURL allowlist" below |
| `max_attachment_bytes` | no | `20971520` (20 MiB) | Cap per inbound file/image download (1:1 and channel). A larger attachment is skipped with a notice rather than buffered. See "Receiving files and images" below |
| `channel_files_enabled` | no | `false` | Opt into reading files attached to the bot in a **channel** (via Graph + `Sites.Selected`). Needs the RSC manifest permission and per-site grants. See "Reading files from a channel" below |

## serviceURL allowlist

The bot sends its replies (carrying its Bot Connector bearer token) to the
`serviceUrl` from each inbound activity. That URL is already bound to a
JWT-validated request, so by default any authenticated `serviceUrl` is trusted —
the same model as the Bot Framework / M365 Agents SDK.

For defense-in-depth (or a compliance lockdown), set `service_url_allowlist` to
the Bot Connector host(s) your tenant's cloud uses; the bot then drops any
activity whose `serviceUrl` host is not listed. Matching is on **host** (so
regional paths like `/amer/`, `/emea/` are fine). Current Microsoft hosts for
reference (verify against Azure docs — this list can change):

| Cloud | Host |
|-------|------|
| Public | `smba.trafficmanager.net` |
| GCC | `smba.infra.gcc.teams.microsoft.com` |
| GCC High | `smba.infra.gov.teams.microsoft.us` |
| DoD | `smba.infra.dod.teams.microsoft.us` |

Leave it empty unless you have a reason to pin — a too-narrow list silently drops
legitimate traffic.

## Receiving files and images

In a **1:1 (personal) chat**, a file or image the user attaches to the bot is
downloaded by the connector and handed to the agent (a file becomes a saved file
the agent can read; an image is passed as an image attachment). Text and an
attachment sent together arrive on the same turn.

**Manifest prerequisite:** for the bot to receive files in 1:1, the Teams app
manifest must declare:

```json
"bots": [
  { "botId": "<your-app-id>", "supportsFiles": true, "scopes": ["personal"] }
]
```

Without `supportsFiles: true`, Teams does not deliver file attachments to the bot
— no connector setting substitutes for it.

**Size limit:** each download is capped by `max_attachment_bytes` (default
20 MiB). An oversized attachment, or one whose download fails, is skipped and the
user gets a brief notice; the turn still proceeds with any text and other
attachments.

## Sending images

When the agent produces an image (or a user runs `cc-connect send --image`), the
bot sends it back **inline** as a base64 data-URI attachment, threaded to the
originating message. It renders in 1:1 chats, group chats, and channels. If the
Bot Connector rejects the image as too large (HTTP 413), the bot degrades to a
brief text notice rather than failing the turn — so Teams' own size limit
governs, not a fixed cap (a generous safety guard only rejects pathologically
large images up front). Sending **files** (non-image) is not supported — Teams
requires a separate file consent / SharePoint flow.

**Not supported:**
- **Outbound files** (the bot *sending* non-image files) are not implemented.
  Outbound **images** are supported (see "Sending images").
- **Channel / group attachments** are handled by a separate, opt-in path — see
  "Reading files from a channel" below.

## Reading files from a channel

Optional (**off by default**). When enabled, a file a user attaches to the bot in
a **channel** message — with a `@mention` of the bot, or in a thread the bot is
already following — is downloaded and handed to the agent, alongside any text in
the same message.

This path differs from 1:1: Teams does **not** put a channel file's reference in
the bot's inbound message, so the connector reads the message through Microsoft
Graph to find the file, then downloads it from SharePoint. That requires two
things an admin sets up once:

1. **RSC permission in the Teams app manifest.** Add the resource-specific
   application permission so the bot can read the channel's messages via Graph:

   ```json
   "webApplicationInfo": {
     "id": "<your-app-id>",
     "resource": "https://RscBasedStoreApp"
   },
   "authorization": {
     "permissions": {
       "resourceSpecific": [
         { "name": "ChannelMessage.Read.Group", "type": "Application" }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   Install (or re-install) the app **to the team** so a team owner consents — a
   fresh install is required for the Graph grant to register (an in-place update
   won't re-consent). This also makes the bot receive un-mentioned channel
   messages (thread-follow).

2. **`Sites.Selected` grant on the file's SharePoint site.** Grant the app the
   `Sites.Selected` **application** permission (one-time admin consent), then grant
   it **read** on each site whose files it should reach:

   ```http
   POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{siteId}/permissions
   { "roles": ["read"], "grantedToIdentities": [ { "application": { "id": "<your-app-id>" } } ] }
   ```

   Find a team's site id from its SharePoint URL, e.g.
   `GET /sites/{tenant}.sharepoint.com:/sites/{TeamName}`. **Private and shared
   channels use their own separate SharePoint sites** — grant each one you want the
   bot to read.

Then enable it in config: `channel_files_enabled = true`.

Notes:
- Uses the narrowest permissions — RSC `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` (per-team) and
  `Sites.Selected` (per-site), **not** the tenant-wide `ChannelMessage.Read.All`.
- The Graph message read is **not metered** (Microsoft retired Teams API metering);
  it runs under normal Graph rate limits.
- A file on a site the app was not granted, or an oversized/failed download, is
  skipped with a brief user notice (bounded by `max_attachment_bytes`).
- Same limits as 1:1: file cards only; outbound send is not implemented.


## Connection type

Webhook (Bot Framework) — **a public HTTPS URL is required**. This is inherent
to the Bot Framework: Teams messages always route through Azure Bot Service,
which POSTs to your endpoint.

## Limitations (MVP)

- Replies stream as an Adaptive Card only. Plain text streaming, a `reply_format`
  toggle, and the native `streamType` 1:1 animation are deferred to follow-ups.
- Permission prompts and AskUserQuestion prompts render as their **own
  interactive Adaptive Card** (Allow / Deny / Allow-all; one button per option) —
  a distinct message, not folded into the streaming answer card, so a prompt is
  never missed. Replying with text (`allow`, `deny`, a number) still works.
  multiSelect questions also render as buttons and resolve on the **first tap**
  (no multi-pick) — reply with comma-separated numbers as text to pick several.
- Inbound files and images are supported in **1:1 chats** (see "Receiving files
  and images"); **channel** files are supported via the opt-in
  `channel_files_enabled` path (see "Reading files from a channel"). Inbound audio
  is not supported.
- No cron/timer → Teams proactive messages (a conversation-reference store is
  needed to send without an incoming activity).
